      The idea behind this project is each participant to create a webpage, using the knowlegde from the Udacity Front End Web Developers challenge. Here we present you those, who answered it. Some of us had little to no previous experience wit html,CSS or
      Javascript, so those are our very first steps in this imense and intriging field. Why we started this project at all, well also like with human languages it is one thing to start learning, but a whole new level to dare to speak it. It is one thing
      to make the Udacity course projects by yourself at your ease, and another to gather and work with different people on a common project, to share files via Github, to upload it online and all the little complications that come with it, that you didn't
      think of while working alone.
